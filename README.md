# Android app
The purpose of the application is to remotely control a manipulator (robotic arm) and a riding platform. The application was written in Kotlin language in Android Studio.

The application is part of the maigster project. The GIF shown below is only 1 of 13 of the videos showing how the application works.
I decided to make public only the logical part of the application!
